# Scott_Feingold_Analytic_SCE_SBE_solutions

These Matlab codes can be used to generate distribution functions corresponding to the Stochastic Collection Equation (SCE) and Stochastic Collection/Breakup Equation (SCE/SBE) of Scott 1968 and Feingold et al. 1988. Each solution uses an initial normalized gamma with integer nu.

Additionally, the script 'Scott_test_PSD_fitting.m' can be used to fit various distribution functions to Scott's and Feingold's solutions.
